### Start point
First of all, ensure you have node, npm, xcode and Android Studio installed on your machine.

- If not already done, install `yarn` (I dont want to see a `package-lock.json` file in the repo !!)
```
npm i -g yarn
```

- Install the `expo-cli`
```
yarn global add expo-cli
```


- Install project dependencies
```
yarn install
```

- Clone the repo (hope you're already using SSH Keys to authenticate to Github)

- Go to the project folder and run
```
yarn start
```

- Enjoy !
